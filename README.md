# 📄 Simple PDF Q\&A System (RAG)

A tiny **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) app. Upload a PDF, ask questions, and get answers grounded in the document — not made up.

This is the Day 7 hands-on project. The code follows the exact steps from the slides:

**Load → Chunk → Embed → Store** (indexing) **→ Retrieve → Augment → Generate** (querying)

---

## Two versions (pick one)

There are two copies of the app. They are identical except for the **Embed** step:

| File | Embeddings come from | Needs |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **app.py** | Hugging Face all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (runs locally) | one-time \~80 MB download; no embedding API cost |
| **app\_gemini\_embeddings.py** | Gemini gemini-embedding-001 (via API) | nothing to download; uses your Gemini key for embeddings too |

- Use **app.py** if you want the exact Day-6 model and no API quota worries while a whole class indexes PDFs at once. Install: pip install \-r requirements.txt  
- Use **app\_gemini\_embeddings.py** if you want the simplest setup — one API, one key, nothing to download. Install: pip install \-r requirements\_gemini\_embeddings.txt

Both behave the same once running.

## What each tool does

| Tool | Job in the app |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Streamlit** | The chat web page (the UI) |
| **LangChain** | Glues the pipeline together |
| **PyPDFLoader** | Reads the PDF into text |
| **Sentence Transformers** | Turns text chunks into vectors (embeddings) |
| **FAISS** | Stores the vectors and searches them fast |
| **Google Gemini** | Writes the final answer |

---

## Setup (5 steps)

### 1\. Get the files

Put app.py and requirements.txt in a folder.

### 2\. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment

python \-m venv venv

\# Windows:

venv\\Scripts\\activate

\# Mac/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

### 3\. Install the libraries

pip install \-r requirements.txt

The first run also downloads the small embedding model (\~80 MB). This happens once, then it's cached.

### 4\. Get a free Google Gemini API key

- Go to [**https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey**](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)  
- Click **Create API key** and copy it.  
- You'll paste it into the app's sidebar (no need to edit any code).

### 5\. Run the app

streamlit run app.py

\# ...or the all-Gemini version:

streamlit run app\_gemini\_embeddings.py

Your browser opens automatically. Then:

1. Paste your API key in the sidebar.  
2. Upload a PDF.  
3. Ask questions\!

## How to use it in class

1. Upload any PDF (a syllabus, a handbook, a research paper).  
2. Ask a question whose answer is **inside** the PDF.  
3. Open **"🔍 See the chunks used to answer"** to show students *exactly* which pieces of the PDF were retrieved. This makes the invisible "retrieval" step visible — the key teaching moment.  
4. Try a question whose answer is **NOT** in the PDF. A good RAG system says "I don't know" instead of hallucinating.

## Tweak these settings (top of app.py)

| Setting | Meaning | Try changing to… |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CHUNK\_SIZE | characters per chunk | 300 (smaller) or 1000 (bigger) |
| CHUNK\_OVERLAP | shared characters between chunks | 0 (see context break\!) |
| TOP\_K | how many chunks to retrieve | 1 or 5 |

Changing CHUNK\_OVERLAP to 0 and asking a question whose answer spans a chunk boundary is a great way to *show* why overlap matters.

---

## Common problems

- **"No module named ..."** → run pip install \-r requirements.txt again (make sure your virtual environment is active).  
- **404 "model not found" OR "no longer available to new users"** → Google retires model names over time and sometimes closes older ones to newly-created API keys. This app defaults to the stable alias **gemini-flash-latest** and also shows a **"Gemini model" dropdown in the sidebar** listing the models *your key* can actually use. If one name fails, just pick another from the dropdown — no code editing needed.  
- **API key error** → make sure you copied the whole key and that the Gemini free tier is enabled for your Google account.  
- **First run is slow** → it's downloading the embedding model once. Later runs are fast.
